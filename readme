--- to do ---
FILE data_wrangling.py is critical:
- Test this file carefully on sanity_checks_data_wrangling.ipynb
- Carefull with features being dropped/dtypes changed in fill_empty_values()
- Do label_encodings_object_dtypes in a better way, turn them into ordinals.
- Not very relevant: change the line object_column_names df.select_dtypes(include='object'))
- Figure out what the actual target is (totals_totalTransactionRevenue?)
- Remove some lines of code in get_fixed_fields(df)
- Review carefully get_cummulate_numeric_fields(df, start_date, end_date, suffix='')... document with a picture
